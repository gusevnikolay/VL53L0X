TOF - VL53L0X Time of Flight distance sensor library

This code is based on the https://github.com/bitbank2/VL53L0X library (see LICENSE.txt)

This library has been modified to use it with several sensors on the I2C bus.
All hardware dependencies must be implemented by the user in his code.
All external dependencies are taken out of the library so that now it can be used both with microcontrollers and under Linux.
This repository provides an example of using the library on the STM32F10x microcontroller.
